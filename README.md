Each search trial was approximated as a sequence of discrete time steps (Δ𝑡 = 50 ms). For each object
𝑖 at time step 𝑡, retinal eccentricity was computed as: 

$$
e_{i,t} = \lVert x_{i,t} - g_t \rVert,
$$

where $x_{i,t}$ and $g_t$ are the object and gaze positions in 2D coordinates. Orientation sensitivity was based on the visibility task data:

$$
S(e,v)=\Phi^{-1}(H(e,v))-\Phi^{-1}(F(e,v)),
$$

where 𝐻(𝑒, 𝑣) and 𝐹(𝑒, 𝑣) are hit and false-alarm rates, 𝑒 standing for retinal eccentricity and
𝑣 for object velocity, and $\Phi^{-1}$ is the inverse cumulative normal distribution. The resulting
values were interpolated across eccentricity to obtain a continuous sensitivity function
𝑆(𝑒, 𝑣) for each velocity condition. At each time step 𝑡, each object 𝑖 produces a noisy internal sensory sample $z_{i,t}$ which was
modelled as a Gaussian random variable:

$$
z_{i,t}\sim
\begin{cases}
\mathcal{N}(0,\eta), & \text{if the object is a distractor},\\
\mathcal{N}(S_{\Delta t}(e_{i,t},v),\eta), & \text{if the object is the target},
\end{cases}
$$

where 𝜂 is the sensory noise variance. Thus, distractors generate noise-only activity, whereas
targets generate signal-plus-noise activity. Per-step sensitivity was derived from the calibrated
𝑆(𝑒, 𝑣), measured over a 400 ms observation window (duration of the visibility task), by
assuming that discriminability grows with the square root of integration time:

$$
S_{\Delta t}(e_{i,t},v)=
\alpha\ S(e_{i,t},v)\sqrt{\frac{\Delta t}{0.4}},
$$

where 𝛼 is a fixed global gain parameter that maps sensitivity measured in the visibility task to
the effective sensory signal during search, absorbing unmodeled factors such as crowding.
Momentary sensory samples were converted into object-wise log-likelihood ratio (LLR) increments:

$$
\Delta\mathrm{LLR}_{i,t}=
\log
\frac{p(z_{i,t}\mid\text{target})}
{p(z_{i,t}\mid\text{distractor})},
$$

where 𝑝(𝑧 ∣ ⋅) represents the probability density of the sensory observation under the specified
hypothesis. Under Gaussian sensory noise with variance 𝜂, this simplifies to

$$
\Delta\mathrm{LLR}_{i,t}={S_{\Delta t}(e_{i,t},v)}{z_{i,t}}-\frac{1}{2}S_{\Delta t}(e_{i,t},v)^2.
$$

Object-specific evidence was accumulated over time:

$$
\mathrm{LLR}_{i,t}=\mathrm{LLR}_{i,t-1}+\Delta\mathrm{LLR}_{i,t}=\sum_{\tau=1}^{t}\Delta\mathrm{LLR}_{i,\tau}.
$$

To infer whether a target was present anywhere in the display, the model used the maximum
object-wise accumulated evidence as the decision variable:

$$
D_t=\max_i \mathrm{LLR}_{i,t}.
$$

At each time step 𝑡, the decision variable $D_t$ was compared against two fixed decision bounds.
A positive upper bound $\Theta_{p}$ governed target-present responses: if $D_t \ge \Theta_{p}$ the model
responded, “target present”, and reaction time was recorded as (𝑡 + 1)Δ𝑡. Target-absent
responses were governed by a fixed negative lower bound; if $D_t \le \Theta_{A}$, the model responded, 
“target absent”, and reaction time was recorded as (𝑡 + 1)Δ𝑡. If no bound was
crossed by stimulus offset (3.5 s), the model responded “target present” if the final decision
variable was positive, and “target absent” if negative.

For each participant, the parameters 𝜂 (sensory noise) and Θ (decision criterion) were
estimated via grid search by minimizing a composite loss function:

$$
L=\sum_v\left[(d'_h-d'_m)^2+(\log RT_h^{TP}-\log RT_m^{TP})^2+(\log RT_h^{TA}-\log RT_m^{TA})^2\right],
$$

where the subscripts *h* and *m* denote human and model respectively, and the sum runs over
velocity conditions 𝑣. Target-present *TP* , and target-absent *TA* reaction times are compared
on a log scale to treat proportional differences equivalently across conditions. Trial-wise
stimulus and gaze time series were precomputed once. Parameter estimation proceeded in
two phases: *η* was searched over [0.002, 0.20] (12 points) and *Θ* over [0.02, 1.0] (12 points),
with a refined search of ±0.15 and ±1.0 respectively around the coarse optimum.
