## Requirements 

- python3 (3.10 or newer)
- PsychoPy (2024.2.4)
- EyeLink 1000 Plus + pylink to run with eye tracking
- RB-530 or similar + pyxid2 to run with Cedrus response box.

## Running 

Run `main.py` through PsychoPy Coder. 

Number of trials and object speed for the search task can be altered by modifying the file `config.py`.

To change the object speed in the visibility task, modify the file `visibility_dynamic.py`.
